### Clicky_Game

* The application renders different images of Pokemons to the screen. Each image listens for click events.
* The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time.
* The user's score  resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffles themselves in a random order.
* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.

## The Application is written with React
